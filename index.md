Hi&mdash;I'm Alberto.
I live in Milan, Italy, with my wife Paola and our three children, Matilde, Elisa and Matteo.

I've been working for [Engitel](http://www.engitel.com) since 2000 as a Web Developer and since 2010 I'm also a partner.
Previously, I've worked for Italtel Sistemi and before as a contractor at [CEFRIEL](http://www.cefriel.it). 

I am a member of [ACM](http://www.acm.org) (Association for Computing Machinery) and since summer 2006, I am [a reviewer](http://www.reviews.com/browse/browse_reviewers.cfm?reviewer_id=123101) 
for ACM [Computing Reviews](http://www.reviews.com).

I seldom write here as well as anywhere else, as a consequence, there's not much to be found around.

* [Arrow of Time](/time): a family project.
* [FM](/fm): visualizing Last.fm scrobbles.
* [Mi ricordo](/mi-ricordo) -- A project inspired by Joe Brainard's "[I remember](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1887123482?ie=UTF8&tag=linusmat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1887123482)" and George Perec's "[Je me souviens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2012354564?ie=UTF8&tag=linusmat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=2012354564)". In Italian.
* [Colophon](/colophon): about the mechanics of these pages.

You can find me elsewhere on the web; my username is usually "bolk" or "albertob", and these are websites I do attend: 

* [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albertob/) -- pictures.
* [Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/bolk) -- music I listen to.
* [LinkedIn](http://it.linkedin.com/in/albertobolchini) -- professional profile, my CV is [here](/stuff/alberto-bolchini-cv.pdf).
* [GitHub](http://github.com/bolk) -- few lines of code.
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/albertob) -- I registered in 2007, but never actually got into it.
* [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/bolk/) -- pins.

I also <em>sort of</em> maintain a couple of other tumblelogs:

* [Stumbling](http://stumbling.linusmat.com/) -- Noticeable quotes, pics, videos found on the web
