In 2002, I found Diego Golberg's [The arrow of Time page](http://www.zonezero.com/magazine/essays/diegotime/time.html). 
I immediatly thought we should have done something alike, and although at the time our family was already of three, we decided to give it a try anyway. The first day we picked out was the 6th of January. After two years, I incautiously reformatted my laptop and swept the pictures away. I hadn't set up this page at that time, so I lost the pictures altogether.
On the 1<sup>st</sup> of May 2004 we started over, and this time I backed-up everything on the Internet.

Since then, we familiarly dubbed the photo-session as "mayday".
