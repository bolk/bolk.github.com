As <a href="/2009/11/02/review-pro-sql-server-2008-analytics-delivering-sales-and-marketing-dashboards/">previously mentioned</a>, I reviewed  “<strong>Pro SQL Server 2008 administration</strong>” by <em>Simmons and Carstarphen</em> for Apress. Today <a title="The leading online service for computing literature" href="http://www.reviews.com/">Computing Reviews</a> published it on their website.
<blockquote><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430223731?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=linusmat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1430223731"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-162" title="Pro SQL Server 2008 administration" src="http://linusmat.com/wp/img/2010/01/51srcjybi3l_sl160_.jpg" alt="Pro SQL Server 2008 administration" width="84" height="110" /></a>This book attempts to be a real-world guide for database administrators (DBAs) who need to be agile enough to switch from a query optimization issue to an auditing request in support of regulatory compliance. The book covers a variety of topics in every DBA’s agenda, and gives specific attention to features that have been introduced, updated, or outdated in the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server. <a href="http://www.reviews.com/review/review_review.cfm?review_id=137640">...</a></blockquote>
