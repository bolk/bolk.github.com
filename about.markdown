## Myself

My name is Alberto Bolchini and I live in Milan, Italy, with my wife Paola and our three children, Matilde, Elisa and Matteo.

I've been working for [Engitel](http://www.engitel.com) since 2000 as a Web Developer.
Previously, I worked for Italtel Sistemi as a Software Analyst and before as a contractor at [CEFRIEL](http://www.cefriel.it)

I am a member of [ACM](http://www.acm.org) (Association for Computing Machinery) and since summer 2006, I am [a reviewer](http://www.reviews.com/browse/browse_reviewers.cfm?reviewer_id=123101) 
for ACM [Computing Reviews](http://www.reviews.com).


## The site

I seldom write here as well as anywhere else, as a consequence, there's not much to be found around.
I have mostly pushed stuff to the web at <a href="http://linusmat.com" title="yes, it's closed">linusmat.com</a> which I have used as a 
playground for various experiments. It is now "closed", and I plan to move the surviving bits over here 
(<a href="http://www.google.com/#q=site:linusmat.com&amp;fp=1">Google</a> won't get upset as there's not much 
to be indexed anyway). 

## Elsewhere

You can find me elsewhere on the web; my username is usually "bolk" or "albertob", and these are websites I do attend: 

* [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com/bolk) -- bookmarks.
* [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/albertob/) -- pictures.
* [Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/bolk) -- music I listen to.
* [LinkedIn](http://it.linkedin.com/in/albertobolchini) -- my CV
* [GitHub](http://github.com/bolk) -- few lines of code.
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/albertob) -- I registered in 2007, but never actually ever got into it.

I also <em>sort of</em> maintain a couple of other tumblelogs:

* [Stumbling](http://stumbling.linusmat.com/) -- Noticeable quotes, pics, videos found on the web
* [Mi ricordo](http://miricordo.linusmat.com/) -- A project inspired by Joe Brainard's "[I remember](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1887123482?ie=UTF8&tag=linusmat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1887123482)" and George Perec's "[Je me souviens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2012354564?ie=UTF8&tag=linusmat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=2012354564)". In Italian.
