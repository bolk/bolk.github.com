I've been an avid reader of O'Reilly technical books and I've always been amazed by their Animal covers such as I'd
begin reading the book by the colophon where you can find details about the animal on the cover, the fonts used in the 
book, and the typesetting process (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain">toolchain</a> changes from
book to book),

yeah
